			<h2>2021 Annual Mailing Notice</h2>

			<p>Dear Loma Vista Homeowners:</p>
			<p>We delayed our mailing notice for the Annual General Meeting and assessments for 2021 as we debated how we should proceed in the light of the ongoing pandemic. <strong>We have decided not to host an in-person meeting in January 2021</strong>, since we do not have a large enough facility to meet and still follow the appropriate safety guidelines to protect our homeowners.</p>
			<p>Since the AGM is where homeowners can ask questions, suggest improvements, etc., we still want to provide a forum to address these topics. If you have a topic that you planned to bring to the meeting, please email it to <a href="mailto:king.dave42@gmail.com">king.dave42@gmail.com</a> or send a letter to our mailing address listed below before February 1, 2021. These will be consolidated, addressed by our volunteer board, and then shared in a follow-up letter by the end of February. We will also post the topics and responses online.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of 2020, we had a handful of improvement projects in our queue, but the number of homeowners who failed to pay the annual assessment for 2020 was higher in the first quarter than typical. Consequently, we completed the project to add extra light poles at our front entrance and then held off any additional work.</p>
			<p>We still have 13 homeowners who haven’t paid the assessment for 2020 and will follow up with each of these in January. Due to the pandemic and related job losses in our area, we held off pursuing these payments since we had sufficient funds to cover the monthly expenses for the remainder of the year.</p>

			<h3>2021 Improvements</h3>

			<p>Our current list of improvements for 2021 includes the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Repair and paint the front wall.</li>
				<li>Repair the waterline and sprinkler system to the middle island.</li>
				<li>Add a basketball pole and hoop to one end of the tennis court.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2021 Annual Dues</h3>

			<p>The Annual Assessment is <strong>$350.00</strong> and <strong>due by February 1, 2021</strong>. It is late if paid after <strong>February 28, 2021</strong>.</p>
			<p class="note alert">Please note, a fine of <strong>$20.00 per month</strong> beginning on March 1, 2021, will be assessed until paid in full. If the annual dues and fines are not paid by April 30, 2021, the HOA will file a lien on your property.</p>
			<p>Please make your check payable to <strong>Loma Vista Homeowners Association</strong> and mail it to:</p>
